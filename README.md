## Wiki Stumble

A Roda app that's like StumbleUpon for Wikipedia, showing summaries of articles tailored to the user's interests and likes/dislikes.

## Why?

This is a remake of [a Rails app by the same name](https://github.com/fpsvogel/wikistumble-rails) that I made two years ago. This time around I wanted to do things a little different:

- Build it with something other than Rails. I chose [Roda](https://roda.jeremyevans.net/).
- Use Turbo Streams for a seamless SPA-like feel.
- Organize and document my code better than I did the first time.
